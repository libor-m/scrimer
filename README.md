# Scrimer: 454 transcriptome data to SNaPShot primers
This project is a pipeline of bash commands driving custom python scripts and 'industry standard' 
bioinformatics applications to design PCR and genotyping primers to read variable SNP sites
distinguishing two species, using a distant reference genome to predict exons in the transcripts.

# Status
Early alpha. Use with care. Publication describing the pipeline is in preparation.
Before using any parts of this pipeline please try to contact me. I can tell
you whether the part you're willing to use is considered working or a dead end just 
before deletoion from the code base.

# License
Probably will be licensed under Affero GPL.
If you use any part of the pipeline, please cite the appropriate publication (in prep now).

# TODO
Choose a license, sign uni agreement?
Move docs to folder?
Generate pdf of the workflow
